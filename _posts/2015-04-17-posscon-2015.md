title: Let's make our own Giants!
---

Last Wednesday I gave my **first** ever presentation/workshop at a conference, [POSSCON](http://posscon.org), about using OSS libraries to accelerate our developments and how to distribute your own. I covered the basics of Android's fantastic new build system [Gradle](https://gradle.org), talking about its flexibility and extensibility as a build language. I went over everything everything from the basic configuration when you create a new project to creating different build types, product flavors, and using open source plugins to enhance your build pipeline. However, I primarily focused on it's robust dependency management system and it's ability to pull dependencies from virtually _everywhere_ and how to upload a library to Sonatype's central repository.

Anyhow, I'm not here to ramble and regurgitate my presentation, which can be found on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/r0adkll/posscon-open-source-and-dependency-management-for-android) if you want to check it out. I'm here to talk about my first time experience talking at a conference and the lessons I took away from it.

### 1) Be Prepared

### 2) Design a flow (see #1)

### 3) Practice. Practice. Practice
