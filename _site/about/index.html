  <p>Hi there! My name is <strong>Drew Heavner</strong> and I&#39;m currently the <strong>Lead Android Engineer</strong> over at <a href="http://52inc.com"><strong>52inc</strong></a>. I&#39;ve been building mobile applications and solutions here for about <strong>2.5 years</strong> now and I have loved every minute of it. In my travels I have learned quite a bit from all my successes, to all my failures, and from all my peers about honing and building my <em>craft</em> and while I think I have become quite proficient at it, I do know I have much to learn.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>

<p>I graduated from the <strong>University of South Carolina</strong> in 2012 with a <strong>B.S.</strong> in <strong>Computer Science</strong> and In my studies I tended my focus and skills on mobile application development and game development. During school I maintained a job doing IT work for the School of Public Health for 3 years until I was recruited by <a href="http://52inc.com"><strong>52inc</strong></a> in my final semester and have been working there ever since.</p>

<h2>Career</h2>

<p>In my time as an Android engineer I have architected, developed, and released over <strong>12</strong> apps and I&#39;m currently working on another two plus a game. One of those apps, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5VfZmBUqS0tQi1pU19JR3M5ZFE/edit?usp=sharing">Metal Slug Zombie Live Wallpaper</a>, managed to garner over 400,000 downloads before it was suspended from the store (for obvious reasons).</p>

<p>From my time doing application development I have found the old adage of <strong>Standing on the shoulders of giants</strong> to be very true. I have come to rely on the beautiful works of others to help make my applications great such as <a href="https://github.com/square">Square&#39;s</a> wonderful libraries and that of other developers in the field. So in the spirit of open sourceness I have shared my discoveries and code at <a href="https://github.com/r0adkll"><strong>Github</strong></a> where some of them have garnered  mild popularity.</p>
