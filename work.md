## Haystack

A [Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com) client application that focuses on the user experience of creating/updating/managing your Harvest timers. Haystack includes the ability to create presets, which are pre-configured timers, which allow you to easily create and set timers. Harvest also has a feature called **Workflows** which allow you to use [bluetooth beacons](http://estimote.com), GPS, or WIFI to trigger workflow events such as starting a timer, stopping a timer, or just showing you a notification so you can decide on the action or not.

_Haystack is Coming Soon..._
