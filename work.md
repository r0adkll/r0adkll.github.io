## Chipper

Chipper is a keygen jukebox player. It has from over 1400 chiptunes that were ripped from keygenerators available to play.

## Haystack

A [Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com) client application that focuses on the user experience of creating/updating/managing your Harvest timers. Haystack includes the ability to create presets, which are pre-configured timers, which allow you to easily create and set timers. Harvest also has a feature called **Workflows** which allow you to use [bluetooth beacons](http://estimote.com), GPS, or WIFI to trigger workflow events such as starting a timer, stopping a timer, or just showing you a notification so you can decide on the action or not.

_Haystack is Coming Soon..._

## Metal Slug Zombie Live Wallpaper

This was my very first Android application that I ever built in an all night bender during a LAN Party. It was a phenomenal success for ~2 years before being removed from the Play Store, for obvious reasons, and garnered **~400,000** downloads. So now I offer it for free for anyone that wants to try it.  

**WARNING:** _It may or may not work as I have stopped maintaining it since it was removed from the store._

[Download Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4foyok6ttwxhxqx/ZombieLiveWallpaper.apk?dl=0)

<p style="font-size: 12pt;"><i>SNK: if there is an issue with me still hosting the Metal Slug fanwork, I will gladly remove it. </i></p>
