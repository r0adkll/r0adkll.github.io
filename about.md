Hi there! My name is **Drew Heavner** and I'm currently the __Lead Android Engineer__ over at [**52inc**](http://52inc.com). I've been building mobile applications and solutions here for about **2.5 years** now and I have loved every minute of it. In my travels I have learned quite a bit from all my successes, to all my failures, and from all my peers about honing and building my _craft_ and while I think I have become quite proficient at it, I do know I have much to learn.

## Education

I graduated from the **University of South Carolina** in 2012 with a **B.S.** in **Computer Science** and In my studies I tended my focus and skills on mobile application development and game development. During school I maintained a job doing IT work for the School of Public Health for 3 years until I was recruited by [**52inc**](http://52inc.com) in my final semester and have been working there ever since.

## Career

In my time as an Android engineer I have architected, developed, and released over **12** apps and I'm currently working on another two plus a game. One of those apps, [Metal Slug Zombie Live Wallpaper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5VfZmBUqS0tQi1pU19JR3M5ZFE/edit?usp=sharing), managed to garner over 400,000 downloads before it was suspended from the store (for obvious reasons).

From my time doing application development I have found the old adage of **Standing on the shoulders of giants** to be very true. I have come to rely on the beautiful works of others to help make my applications great such as [Square's](https://github.com/square) wonderful libraries and that of other developers in the field. So in the spirit of open sourceness I have shared my discoveries and code at [**Github**](https://github.com/r0adkll) where some of them have garnered  mild popularity.
